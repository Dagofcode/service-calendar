# About

This app is a platform to serve for community service projects for the community.
The idea is that providers of hours can publish their events in the page and have
the community be notified of when and where they can sign up fo this event.
The way it works is a user can make posts when they register as a provider, they enter
into their profile and select the tab "create an event". Once they do, they can edit, delete, 
or simply make a new post.
