#About
This app is a platform to serve for community service projects for the community.
The idea is that providers of hours can publish their events in the page and have
the community be notified of when and where they can sign up fo this event.

#Future Plans
I plan to continue updating the app with the needed features. Right now it lacks more
functionality with the user accounts
