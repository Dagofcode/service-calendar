# About

This app is a platform to serve for community service projects for the community.
The idea is that providers of hours can publish their events in the page and have
the community be notified of when and where they can sign up fo this event.
The way it works is a user can make posts when they register as a provider, they enter
into their profile and select the tab "create an event". Once they do, they can edit, delete, 
or simply make a new post. 

# Testing Accounts
These are accounts incase a user wants to test or they can simply make new accounts.

# Future Plans

I plan to continue updating the app with the needed features. Right now it lacks more
functionality with the user accounts
